  <p>Hi, My name is Achok Khenrap Yeshi.</p>

  <p>I am currently a SofNet engineer working for the government. I am certified in many cyber security and networking related industry certifications like Network+, Security+, Cisco Certified Network Associate, Cisco Certified Network Professional, Certified Ethical Hacker, Linux+ and more.</p>

  <p>As the world gets more integrated with the global networks of fibers optics, telecommunication satellites and futuristic means of transporation that will make physical distance a yester-memory, the one portal that links all of these technologies of tomorrow will be met with many cyber-related issues. alright... no more blahblahblah...</p>

  <p>These days, i dabble with soft-side of the internet when time allows. It's probably difficult to be a good artist with soft and hard and in-between; yet, its not not achievable & that's really the whole point: I am a warrior!</p>

  <p>Since 2015, I have partially secluded to a medium of meditation and transformation stripping myself of the social networking privileges, with the exception to <a href="https://twitter.com/augusta_007/">Twitter</a>. I love <a href="https://anchor.fm/august36/">sharing</a> story and reading things for fun.</p>

  <p>I also have my outdated <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>, if you like that kind of stuff.</p>
